OpenInput
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OpenInput library is intended as a free, easy-to-use, cross-platform
input handler library. The goal is to provide a SDL-like interface to
input devices such as keyboards, mice and joysticks while keeping the
dependencies for the library at a bare minimum.

As a user of OpenInput, you will find it very easy to use: The functions 
and data structures are intuitive and fully documented. The library has 
support for both event-based input handling, and for state-based events, 
also known as unbuffered input.

For the developer, the internal design of OpenInput is highly modular: 
The device drivers are decoupled from the library itself, which makes it 
very easy to write additional drivers. The internal API is ofcourse also
fully documented (as are the device drivers).

A lot of code has been ripped, abused and otherwise mangled and
mingled from the SDL project (http://www.libsdl.org/), and you
should know that

       Without the EXCELLENT piece of software SDL is
       OpenInput would simply never have existed!
       Thank you so much and keep up the good work!
